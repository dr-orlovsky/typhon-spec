Typhon: trustless Bitcoin sidechain protocol
===

Typhon is Bitcoin second-layer technology – the same kind as Lightning network. You can think of it as 
of massively-scalable multiparty payment channels. Name Typhon comes from Greek mythology, it's a kind of
multi-coiled snake or dragon that is able to bring storms: multiple coins are multiple sidechains and storms 
are the analogy for supreme qualities of this 2nd layer technology as compared to the Lightning network.

*Lightning ⚡️ brings thunderbolt 🌩 – Typhon 🐉 brings typhoon🌪*

Motivation
---

*TBD. Briefly: Lightning has some limitations, existing sidechain 2-way peg technologies requires soft or hardforks, 
and currently can operate only in trusted mode as federation. We need more scalable 2-nd layer technologies
without these limitations.*

General Design
---

Typhon is a **non-2-way peg** trustless sidechain solution that can be implemented existing Bitcoin Script
functionality, i.e. without any soft- or hardforks.

**Main Principles**
+ Censorship resistance in sidechain participation not worse than in main Bitcoin PoW chain
+ No special tokens, support for native bitcoin
+ Fast funds transfer to and from sidechain
