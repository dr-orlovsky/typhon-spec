Typhon is Bitcoin second-layer technology ‚Äì the same kind as Lightning network. You can think of it as of massively-scalable multiparty payment channels. The protocol defines the process of sidechain formation and operation on top of the main Bitcoin blockchain. It is censorship-resistant, permissionless and agnostic to the particular consensus and blockchain formation protocol used by sidechain implementations. 

Name Typhon comes from Greek mythology, it's a kind of multi-coiled snake or dragon that is able to bring storms:  "multiple coils" serve as an analogy to multiple sidechains, while "storms" are the analogy for supreme qualities of this 2nd layer technology as compared to simple payment channels.

Motivation / Cover Letter

*TL;DR: Lightning has some limitations, existing sidechain 2-way peg technologies requires soft or hardforks, and currently can operate only in trusted mode as federation. We need more scalable 2-nd layer technologies without these limitations.*

The idea for the protocol originated from my research on the lack of deterministic finality in PoW consensus which makes very hard to design trustless sidechains without decreasing the security of the main chain with a new soft- or hard-forks. At the same time the absence of a finality property in PoW consensus is an important trade-off decision allowing to run the main chain in censorship-resistant manner, so we can't do anything with it.

So why do we need sidechains at all if we have the Lightning network? A lot of reasons; one of them is that there is a class of potential bitcoin applications that require global state (which Lightning technology obviously does not have) ‚Äì¬†like [proof of computing work protocol](https://www.slideshare.net/pandoraboxchain/proof-of-computing-work-protocol-by-pandora-boxchain) for scaling high-load computing in censorship-resistant way previously designed by my team. Such solutions can‚Äôt be put onto the main PoW chain because of its scalability problems. But what if, instead of 2-way peg sidechains (which with the current bitcoin protocol version can be only federated, i.e. not censorship-resistant), we use the same technology to take bitcoins off the main chain like in the Lightning network, but instead of bringing them into the "payment channel" we will leave them locked ("locked stake") with some CLTV/HTLC-kind of a contract? You can think of it as a "Lightning sidechain" ‚Äì or, simply, typhoon (something much larger than just a lightning). Yes, the lightning itself does not need a "chain" (since it does not need a global state), but as I told earlier, many other apps on top of bitcoin will need such thing.

Such sidechains can run any non-PoW consensus which (a) would not produce inflation, operating only on commissions, (b) will take "block producers" from that HTLC-like commitment transactions on the main bitcoin PoW chain, which will guarantee censorship resistance even if the sidechain protocol is not censorship-resistant by itself (kind of "PoW externality for censorship-resistance"); it can be used to build lightning channels on top of it ‚Äì i.e. be a kind of generic sidechain protocol without drawbacks of existing 2-way peg type sidechains. As for bitcoin itself, it will render bitcoin as a platform for many kinds of applications and use cases it can‚Äôt be used today, increasing its adoption outside of SoV/MoE + micropayments paradigms in such domains as high load computing, data synchronisation etc ‚Äì everything that requires global state that can't fit into the 1st layer or be held in existing 2-nd layer stack in a trustless manner.

General Design
---

Typhon is a **non-2-way peg** trustless sidechain solution that can be implemented using existing Bitcoin Script functionality, i.e. without any soft- or hardforks.

### Design Principles
+ **Censorship resistance**: the protocol must be permissionless and allow at least the same level of censorship resistance as the main Bitcoin PoW chain
+ **Native to Bitcoin**: the protocol should allow fast Bitcoin transfers to and from sidechain
+ **Nothing more then Bitcoin**: to operate the protocol should not require any new/special tokens or coins. Economical incentives can be commission/fee based and are not part of this specification
+ **Conseusus agnosticism**: the protocol should not depend on a particular consensus and blockchain-formation protocols used in sidechain
+ **High Byzantine tolerance**: the protocol should tolerate up to 50%-1 Byzantine faults
+ **Off-chain**: most of the protocol communications should be performed outside of Bitcoin blockchain

### Core Assumptions
+ Elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) is a NP-problem having no feasible deterministic solution.
+ The sidechains are operated by a **honest majority** (i.e. the most of the block-producing nodes are non-Byzantine).
+ The sidechains run any kind of 50%+1 Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus and blockchain formation protocol.
+ A sidechain consensus must have a concept of **epochs**, within which the state of the sidechain reaches finality. 
+ Each epoch must have a predictable duration known before the start of the epoch, i.e. there should be an ability to deterministically compute the time of the next final state for the sidechain before the epoch begins.

### Workflow

Any can commit to participate in a Typhon-based sidechain by creating and adding a special **sidechain commit transaction** (or simply **commitment transaction**) to the Bitcoin blockchain that locks some pre-defined per-sidechain stake in Bitcoins that secures the sidechain from Byzantine faults. This commitment is time-limited (the transaction is a very special form of CLTV-transaction) and must be longer than the duration of two next *epochs* of the sidechain.

To construct the *commitment transaction* committer needs to participate a special distributed shared secret protocol named **Apophis**, which leads to the creation of public-private ECDSA key pair in such a way that the public key is known to all of the participants while the private key can be revealed only with a threshold signature from the honest majority of the *Apophis* protocol (which later becomes a honest majority of the sidechain epoch).

The sidechain is blockchain-based replicating state machine with a shared global state. Its state can be updated within epoch by the **leader** of particular sidechain protocol such that each of the leaders should produce some amount of blocks strictly proportional to the stake locked in the *commitment transaction*. By the end of the epoch the sidechain leaders must reach finality in a consensus on the global sidechain state. Typhon protocol leaves other details of the sidechain implementation flexible and up to particular sidechain design.

At the end of each epoch the stakes of the *leaders* that have being found Byzantine-faulty by the sidechain *honest majority* are **slashed** to the main chain miner that will include the **slashing transaction** to the bitcoin blockchain while the rest of the *leaders* will be able to unlock their funds at the end of the next epoch.

Main chain bitcoins can be moved to and from the sidechain in a quick manner using atomic swap contracts between the main chain and sidechain participants.

### Differences to Existing 2nd Layer Technologies
+ The protocol does not require to lock the funds in order to transfer them off-chain, instead it relies on atomic swapps with the main chain for liquidity provision
+ The funds locked in the *commitment transactions* are just time-locked and can't be used off-chain like with  2-way pegs or Lightning payment channel HTLC-contracts.
+ No other party is required to become participant of the Typhon sidechain, while Lightning protocol requires to find the other party for payment channel setup and 2-way-pegged sidechain requires federation for the multisig peg contract.
+ Quick on-chain settlement/finalization, while the closing of Lightning channels or releasing funds from the peg takes much more time.
+ No complex multisig or multiparty unsigned contracts required: each participants enters and leaves the Typhon sidechain with a much simple P2WSH/P2SH transaction with only one output. The commitment transaction occupies much smaller on-chain size than multisig transactions from sidechain federation or Lightning payment channel.

Protocol Details

### Apophis protocol

*TBD*

The protocol results in creation and revealing of ECDSA public keys `P(i)` specific to each party `i` and the creation of corresponding party-specific unknown private keys `x(i)`. Private keys are unknown because they are kept in distributed way by all protocol participants in a form of shared secrets under threshold signatures algorithm so each of them can't be revealed without agreement from the *honest majority* of the participants.

*Apophis is another snake from Greek (and initially Egyptian) mythology, a predecessor of the Typhon. It hides in a dark abyss in the underworld, like the private keys from the protocol above.*
